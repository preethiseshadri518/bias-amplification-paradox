    "+ Structure/phrasing seems to be very important for similarity. For example, texts that follow the structure \"A photo of the face of a/an [OCCUPATION]\" (where the occupation is not singer) have higher similarity scores than several texts that pertain to the occupation singer (e.g. \"Singer recording a song in studio\")."
